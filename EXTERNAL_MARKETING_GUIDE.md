# External Marketing Question in Play Console

## What This Question Means

The question asks: **"Do you want your app to be advertised outside Google Play?"**

This is about whether **Google** can use your app's assets (name, icon, screenshots, description) for promotional purposes outside the Play Store.

## What "External Marketing" Means

### If You Answer "YES" (Enable External Marketing):

**What Google Can Do:**
- ✅ Use your app's name, icon, and screenshots in ads on:
  - Google Search results
  - YouTube
  - Partner websites and apps (third-party sites)
  - Google Display Network
  - Other Google advertising platforms

**What This Means:**
- Google may show your app in ads when people search for related terms
- Your app could appear in promotional content on partner sites
- Google can use your assets to promote your app across their network
- **You don't pay for this** - it's Google's promotional activity

**Benefits:**
- ✅ More visibility for your app
- ✅ Potential for more downloads
- ✅ Free promotion by Google
- ✅ App may appear in search results and related content

**Potential Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Less control over where your app is advertised
- ⚠️ Your app assets used on third-party sites
- ⚠️ May appear in contexts you didn't choose

---

### If You Answer "NO" (Disable External Marketing):

**What Google Can Still Do:**
- ✅ Show your app in Google Play Store
- ✅ Show your app in Google Search results (organic search)
- ✅ Show your app on YouTube (in Play Store context)
- ✅ Show your app in Gmail (Play Store links)

**What Google Cannot Do:**
- ❌ Use your app in ads on third-party websites
- ❌ Use your app in ads on partner apps
- ❌ Use your app in Google Display Network ads
- ❌ Promotional campaigns outside Google-owned properties

**Benefits:**
- ✅ More control over where your app appears
- ✅ Only on Google-owned platforms
- ✅ More privacy-focused approach

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Less visibility
- ⚠️ Fewer potential downloads
- ⚠️ No free promotion on external sites

## Important Notes

### This is NOT About:
- ❌ Whether YOU will advertise your app (that's separate)
- ❌ Whether you'll pay for advertising (this is free promotion by Google)
- ❌ Whether your app will be listed in Play Store (it will be either way)
- ❌ Whether users can find your app (they can search and find it either way)

### This IS About:
- ✅ Whether Google can use your app assets for their promotional campaigns
- ✅ Whether your app can appear in ads outside Google Play
- ✅ Whether Google can promote your app on partner sites

---

## Cost Implications

**Important:** This setting does NOT cost you anything!

- **If you enable it:** Google may promote your app for free (you don't pay)
- **If you disable it:** Google won't promote it externally (you still don't pay)

**Separate Topic:** If YOU want to run paid Google Ads campaigns for your app, that's a completely separate thing and costs money. This question is not about that.
