# Public Merchant Profile Setup Guide

The **Public merchant profile** is your developer profile that appears on the Google Play Store. This is what users see when they click on your developer name.

---

## Where to Find It

1. **Go to Google Play Console**
2. **Left sidebar** → **"Settings"** (gear icon at bottom)
3. **"Developer account"** → **"Public merchant profile"**

---

## ⚠️ Privacy Concerns & What's Actually Required

### For FREE Apps with Ads (Your Case):

**Good News:** You have more flexibility!

- ✅ **Developer Name:** Required (but can be a brand name, not your real name)
- ✅ **Developer Email:** Required (can be a dedicated support email)
- ❌ **Physical Address:** Usually NOT required for free apps
- ❌ **Phone Number:** Optional (most skip this)

**The Public Merchant Profile is primarily required for:**
- Paid apps
- Apps with in-app purchases
- Some business accounts

For a free app with ads, you typically only need name and email.

---

## Privacy-Friendly Options

### 1. Developer Name (Required - But Use a Brand Name!)

**You DON'T have to use your real name!** Use a brand/business name instead:

**Privacy-Friendly Examples:**
- "Recipe Parser" ✅ (brand name)
- "Recipe Parser Studio" ✅
- "Recipe Apps" ✅
- "Cooking Tools" ✅

**Avoid:**
- "Enrico's Apps" ❌ (reveals your name)
- "John Smith" ❌ (real name)

**Recommendation:** Use "Recipe Parser" - it's professional and doesn't reveal your identity.

---

### 2. Developer Email (Required - Use a Dedicated Email)

**Create a separate email just for app support:**

**Options:**
- `support@recipeparser.app` (if you get a domain)
- `recipeparser.app@gmail.com` (free Gmail account)
- `recipeparser.support@gmail.com` (free Gmail account)

**Benefits:**
- Keeps your personal email private
- Easy to filter/monitor
- Can forward to your personal email if needed
- Looks more professional

**Recommendation:** Create a free Gmail account like `recipeparser.support@gmail.com`

---

### 3. Developer Website (Optional - Use Your Existing Site)

**Use your GitHub Pages or Google Sites:**
- `https://yourusername.github.io` ✅
- `https://sites.google.com/view/yoursite` ✅

**Benefits:**
- Doesn't reveal personal information
- Already set up for privacy policy
- Professional appearance

---

### 4. Physical Address (Usually NOT Required for Free Apps)

**For free apps with ads, you typically DON'T need to provide an address.**

**If Google asks for it (rare for free apps):**
- **Option 1:** Leave blank (if allowed)
- **Option 2:** Use a PO Box (if you want to provide something)
- **Option 3:** Use a virtual business address service (if available in your country)

**Most individual developers of free apps:** Skip this entirely.

---

### 5. Phone Number (Optional - Skip It)

**Recommendation:** Leave blank. Most developers don't provide this.

---

## What Google Actually Requires

### For Your App (Free with Ads):

**Minimum Required:**
1. ✅ Developer Name (use brand name: "Recipe Parser")
2. ✅ Developer Email (use dedicated support email)

**Not Required:**
- ❌ Physical Address (usually not needed for free apps)
- ❌ Phone Number (optional)
- ⚠️ Website (optional but recommended)

**If Google asks for address:**
- This is unusual for free apps
- May be required in some countries/regions
- Contact Google support if you're concerned

---

## Recommended Privacy-Friendly Setup

### For Your Free App (Recommended):

```
Developer Name: Recipe Parser
Developer Email: recipeparser.support@gmail.com (dedicated support email)
Developer Website: https://yourusername.github.io (optional)
Phone Number: (leave blank)
Physical Address: (leave blank - usually not required)
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ No personal name revealed
- ✅ No personal address needed
- ✅ Dedicated email keeps personal email private
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Meets Google's requirements for free apps

### If Google Insists on Address (Rare):

**Option 1:** Contact Google Support
- Explain you're an individual developer
- Ask if address can be waived for free apps

**Option 2:** Use PO Box (if available in your country)
- Provides a business address without revealing home address
- Check local PO Box costs

**Option 3:** Virtual Business Address
- Some services provide virtual addresses
- Check availability and cost in your country

## Why Google Requires This (And Your Options)

### Why Developer Name & Email Are Required:

1. **User Trust:** Users can contact you about issues
2. **Transparency:** Shows who's behind the app
3. **Support:** Provides a way for users to get help
4. **Legal:** Helps with app ownership disputes

### Why Address Usually Isn't Required for Free Apps:

- **Free apps** don't process payments, so less regulatory need
- **Individual developers** often don't have business addresses
- **Google understands** privacy concerns for individuals

### Your Privacy Options:

✅ **Use a brand name** (not your real name)  
✅ **Use a dedicated support email** (not personal email)  
✅ **Skip address** (usually not required for free apps)  
✅ **Skip phone** (optional)
