chore: restructure project to follow Melos workspace conventions

BREAKING CHANGE: Project structure has been reorganized to follow standard
Melos monorepo conventions. This affects all file paths and requires
updating any scripts or documentation that reference old paths.

## Major Changes

### Project Structure
- Moved app code from root `lib/` to `apps/recipe_keeper/`
- Created `apps/` directory for applications
- Maintained `packages/` directory for shared packages
- All platform-specific folders (android, ios, web, etc.) moved to app directory

### Melos Configuration
- Migrated from `melos.yaml` to `pubspec.yaml` with `melos:` section (Melos v7+)
- Added `resolution: workspace` to all package `pubspec.yaml` files
- Updated all package dependencies to use relative `path:` references
- Updated root `pubspec.yaml` to include Melos workspace configuration

### File Organization
- Moved all documentation files (27 .md files) to `docs/` folder
- Moved all Python scripts (6 files) to `scripts/` folder
- Moved all shell scripts (4 files) to `scripts/` folder
- Updated `.gitignore` for new directory structure

### Code Updates
- Updated `main.dart` to wrap app with `ProviderScope` for Riverpod
- Updated all import paths in app code to reflect new structure
- Updated package dependency paths in all `pubspec.yaml` files

## Migration Notes

- Run `dart pub get` from workspace root before working with packages
- Run `flutter pub get` from `apps/recipe_keeper/` for the app
- All documentation is now in `docs/` folder
- All scripts are now in `scripts/` folder
- App entry point is now `apps/recipe_keeper/lib/main.dart`

## Files Changed

- Created: `apps/recipe_keeper/` directory with all app files
- Created: `docs/` directory with all documentation
- Created: `scripts/` directory with all scripts
- Updated: Root `pubspec.yaml` with Melos configuration
- Updated: All package `pubspec.yaml` files with workspace resolution
- Updated: `.gitignore` for new structure
- Deleted: `melos.yaml` (migrated to `pubspec.yaml`)
